# Repository created for learning Terraform OSS
This repository has been created only for learning purposes to run Terraform with the GitHub Provider

### Prerequisites

- [X] [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

## How to Use this Repo

- Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:dlavric/tf-github-provider.git
```

- Go to the directory where the repo is stored and make sure the `main.tf` file is there too:
```shell
cd tf-github-provider
```

- Run `terraform init`, to download any external dependency
```shell
terraform init
```

This is the output of initializing the Terraform code:
```shell
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding integrations/github versions matching "4.20.0"...
- Installing integrations/github v4.20.0...
- Installed integrations/github v4.20.0 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 38027F80D7FD5FB2)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

- Apply the changes with Terraform
```shell
terraform apply
```

This is the output for applying the changes:
```shell

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.```
```
